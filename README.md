Requirements

-   A random word should be selected from a set of words 
-   The player should get wordLength + 2 guesses
-   You need not create a literal hanged man but there should be some representative of guesses used/remaining
-   There should be a visualisation of letters used/unused
-   There should be an acknowledgement of completion (success or fail)

This Defines the most basic requirements, once you've achieved this, for an extension think about how you might scale the application. 

For the following extensions you can either implement them, prepare your existing code ready for them, or simply think about them and then we can discuss them later in the week.

Extension requirements / points to think on

-   How might you allow for the word set to be changed without changing your code (maybe an external file?)
-   How might you implement a score 
-   How might you implement a timer
-   How might you implement a difficulty selector
-   How might you implement a share button (think the end of wordle)
    How might this work at different screen sizes
-   What are some ways you could make the application more robust (think along the lines of for example what happens if someone added a string to the list of words that was 24+ characters long, or if there were no words in the list at all etc.)
